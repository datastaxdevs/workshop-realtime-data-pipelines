## Architecture Design

_Reviews of various venues (hotels/restaurants), written by various users, keep pouring in. We need a way to clean, normalize and filter them, removing trolls and flagging blatant outlier reviews, and make the running results available to the end user._

### Architecture overview

<img src="./images/current_arch.png"/>

<details>
<summary><b> Show Detailed explanations</b></summary>

<ul>
<li>A stream of "events" (messages), some of which are reviews, is poured into a Pulsar topic for "raw reviews".
<li>A Pulsar function filters out malformed items and those that do not specify their target type (restaurant/hotel). This function takes care of normalizing the incoming reviews, since - as is often the case in real life - certain field names in the incoming reviews can have multiple forms. All reviews are encoded as JSON strings. The Pulsar function singles out hotel and restaurant reviews and routes them, after normalizing their structure, to two specific topics. 
<li>We happen to be interested in restaurants, so we have a long-running process ("analyzer") performing the actual analysis on these. Heavy artillery, such as AI/ML-based classifiers, code with fat dependencies and the like, would be placed here (i.e outside Pulsar).

<li>The analyzer keeps listening to the restaurant topic and ingests all incoming reviews: it keeps and update a state with key information, such as a rolling average score per each restaurant.

<li>As new items arrive, they are checked if they are "troll reviews" (review text in heavy disagreement with the numeric score) and, if so, discarded. Otherwise they enter the rolling average for the target restaurant.

<li>The analyzer periodically publishes an assessment for users and restaurants to a database, ready to be queried by any service that may need this data. (The output can also go to console if so desired). The destination DB also offers a ready-to-use REST API that allows to retrieve its data with simple HTTP requests, making it easy to build panels and UIs on top of this pipeline. The analyzer also reroutes "outlier reviews" (scores much different than the current rolling average) to another Pulsar topic, for a hypothetical manual inspection of such outliers.
</ul>
</p>
</details>

### Injector Component

<img src="./images/plots/02_reviews.png"/>

<details>
<summary><b> Show Details</b></summary>
<p>
There is a pseudorandom procedure to generate reviews with features that fluctuate in a predictable
way: it is all in the `revGenerator` directory.

There is no "time" in the generation: to keep things simple, we use a "sequence index" in place of
time. Also, some of the "reviews" are not even valid JSON strings but contain gibberish instead,
as is often the case in real-life data ingestion pipelines!

Each time a review is created, a venue (target) and a user (reviewer) are chosen at random: then,
score and text are also created according to the following rules:

Each venue has a "true" quality that is slowly oscillating in time, see for example these two restaurants:

<img src="./images/plots/01_real-values.png"/>

Each reviewer has an associate amplitude that dictates how widely the scores they produce
may fluctuate away from the "true" value for that venue at that "time": in this example, the individual
scores emitted by two different reviewers, having a large and small associated amplitude, are plotted:

<img src="./images/plots/02_reviews.png"/>

While reviews by Rita will presumably all fall in the "expected" region around the current average,
a large fraction of the reviews by Anne will be too far away from
it and thus be flagged as "outlier reviews".

Each review comes with an associated text, which in this toy
example is simply a bunch of words strung together, some positive ("delicious") and some negative ("disgusting").
Each reviewer, however, has a Boolean "trolliness" flag: if true, then this text is built in strong
disagreement with the numeric score in the review.
</p>
</details>

### Analyzer Component

<img src="./images/plots/03_moving-average.png"/>

<details>
<summary><b> Show Details</b></summary>
<p>
On the **analyzer side**, the reconstructed rolling average roughly follows the "true" quality for
a venue, and is used to detect "outliers": each review that differs too much from the current rolling
average is deemed an outlier. Here the rolling average corresponding to the above restaurant is plotted:

<img src="./images/plots/03_moving-average.png"/>

The analyzer also discards troll reviews and keeps a running 
counter of them, both per-user and per-restaurant, ready to be exposed with the other data. To do so, a toy version of a sentiment analysis is implemented (simply based on some words with positive
and negative connotation) and used to compare with the numeric
score given in the review.

# 🏁 Start Hands-on

## Setup - Initialize your environment

#### ✅ S.1 Start Gitpod IDE

Gitpod is an IDE based on VSCode deployed in the cloud.

> ↗️ _Right Click and select open as a new Tab..._

<a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-realtime-data-pipelines"><img src="https://dabuttonfactory.com/button.png?t=Open+Gitpod&f=Open+Sans-Bold&ts=16&tc=fff&hp=20&vp=10&c=11&bgt=unicolored&bgc=0b5394" /></a>

#### ✅ S.2 Create Astra Account

_**`ASTRA`** is the simplest way to run both Cassandra and Pulsat with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your clusters. No credit card required_

Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/#c-procedure) create a database. *Right-Click the button* with *Open in a new TAB.*

The Astra registration page should have opened with Gitpod, if not use [this link](https://astra.dev/yt-9-14).


#### ✅ S.3 Create Astra Credentials (token)

Create an application token by following <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/" target="_blank">these instructions</a>. 

Skip this step is you already have a token. You can reuse the same token in our other workshops, too.

> Your token should look like: `AstraCS:....`

#### ✅ S.4 Setup Astra CLI

Go back to your gitpod terminal waiting for your token.

> 🖥️ Output
>
> ```

> ```

- List your existing Users.

```
astra user list
```

> 🖥️ Output
>
> ```
> +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------+
> | User Id                              | User Email                  | Status              |

> +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------+
> ```

#### ✅ S.5 Create your database

- Create database `workshops` and keyspace `trollsquad` if they do not exist:

```
astra db create workshops -k trollsquad --if-not-exist --wait
```

Let's analyze the command:
| Chunk         | Description     |
|--------------|-----------|
| `db create` | Operation executed `create` in group `db`  |
| `workshops` | Name of the database, our argument |
|`-k trollsquad` | Name of the keyspace, a db can contains multiple keyspaces |
| `--if-not-exist` | Flag for itempotency creating only what if needed |
| `--wait` | Make the command blocking until all expected operations are executed (timeout is 180s) |

> **Note**: If the database already exist but has not been used for while the status will be `HIBERNATED`. The previous command will resume the db an create the new keyspace but it can take about a minute to execute.

> 🖥️ Output
>
> ```
> [ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' already exist. Connecting to database.
> [ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' has status 'MAINTENANCE' waiting to be 'ACTIVE' ...
>[ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' has status 'ACTIVE' (took 7983 millis)
> ```

- ✅ Check the status of database `workshops`

```
astra db status workshops

## LAB1 - Producer and Consumer

#### 1.1 Create tenant

> **Note**: Your tenant name must start with a lowercase alphabetic character. It can only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters, and hyphens (kebab-case), and the maximum length is 25.

- ✅ Generate an unique tenant name

A tenant name should also BE UNIQUE IN ALL CLUSTER. So to get a unique name let's generate one randomly.

```
export TENANT="trollsquad-$(tr -dc a-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 9 ; echo '')"
echo $TENANT
```

> 🖥️ Output (*faked, I am not that lucky*)
>
> ```
> trollsquad-abcdefghi
>```

- ✅ Create the tenant using the generated name

You can create a tenant from the user interface using [this tutorial](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-streaming/docs/astream-quick-start.html#create-a-tenant) but we will not use this today.

We will use the CLI for everyone to share the same values for regions and cloud provider. We will default all values for simplicity and because they are harcoded in the configuration file.

```
astra streaming create ${TENANT}
```

```
[ INFO ] - Tenant 'trollsquad-abcdefghi' has being created.
```

- ✅ List your tenants

```
astra streaming list
```

- ✅ Start `Pulsar-shell`

> **Note** Pulsar shell is a fast and flexible shell for Pulsar cluster management, messaging, and more. It's great for quickly switching between different clusters, and can modify cluster or tenant configurations in an instant.

Astra CLI will download and install the software if needed. Then it will generate a `client.conf` based on the tenant name you provide.

```
astra streaming pulsar-shell ${TENANT}
```

> 🖥️ Output
> ```
> [ INFO ] - pulsar-shell first launch, downloading (~ 60MB), please wait...
> [ INFO ] - pulsar-shell has been installed
> /home/gitpod/.astra/lunastreaming-shell-2.10.1.1/conf/client-aws-useast2-trollsquad-pk6oztya8.conf
> Pulsar-shell is starting please wait for connection establishment...
> Using directory: /home/gitpod/.pulsar-shell
> Welcome to Pulsar shell!
>   Service URL: pulsar+ssl://pulsar-aws-useast2.streaming.datastax.com:6651
>   Admin URL: https://pulsar-aws-useast2.api.streaming.datastax.com
> 
> Type help to get started or try the autocompletion (TAB button).
> Type exit or quit to end the shell session.
> 
> default(pulsar-aws-useast2.streaming.datastax.com)> 
> ```

#### 1.2 Create topics

- ✅ Show namespaces in `pulsar-shell`

```
admin namespaces list ${TENANT}
```

> 🖥️ Output
>
> ```
> trollsquad-abcdefghijkl/default
>```

- ✅ Show topics in `pulsar-shell` (empty)

```bash
admin topics list ${TENANT}/default
```

- ✅ Create topics `rr-raw-in`, `rr-hotel-reviews` `rr-restaurant-reviews` `rr-restaurant-anomalies`.

You can create topics through the user interface following this [official documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-streaming/docs/astream-quick-start.html#create-a-topic) and [awesome-astra](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-topic/). 

But here we will keep leveraging on `pulsar-shell`.

```
admin topics create persistent://${TENANT}/default/rr-raw-in
admin topics create persistent://${TENANT}/default/rr-hotel-reviews
admin topics create persistent://${TENANT}/default/rr-restaurant-reviews
admin topics create persistent://${TENANT}/default/rr-restaurant-anomalies
```

- ✅ Show topics

```
admin topics list ${TENANT}/default
```

> 🖥️ Output
>
> ```
> persistent://trollsquad-pk6oztya8/default/rr-raw-in
> persistent://trollsquad-pk6oztya8/default/rr-restaurant-anomalies
> persistent://trollsquad-pk6oztya8/default/rr-hotel-reviews
> persistent://trollsquad-pk6oztya8/default/rr-restaurant-reviews
> ```

- ✅ Exit

```
exit
```

- ✅ Show your topic `rr-raw-in` in Astra User Interface:

```
ORGID=`astra org id`
gp preview --external https://astra.datastax.com/org/${ORGID}/streaming/pulsar-aws-useast2/tenants/${TENANT}/topics/namespaces/default/topics/rr-raw-in/1/0/overview
```

#### 1.3 Start injector (producer)

- Create `.env` as configuration file

```
cp .env.sample .env
ASTRA_DB_ID=`astra db get workshops --key id`
echo "ASTRA_DB_ID=\"${ASTRA_DB_ID}\"" >> .env
ASTRA_DB_APP_TOKEN=`astra config get default --key ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN`
echo "ASTRA_DB_APP_TOKEN=\"${ASTRA_DB_APP_TOKEN}\"" >> .env
echo "TENANT=\"${TENANT}\"" >> .env
PULSAR_TOKEN=`astra streaming pulsar-token ${TENANT}`
echo "PULSAR_TOKEN=\"${PULSAR_TOKEN}\"" >> .env
ORGID=`astra org id`
echo "ORGID=\"${ORGID}\"" >> .env

tail -5 .env
```

- Install dependencies

```
set -a
source .env
set +a
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Start the generator

```
./revGenerator/review_generator.py -r 10
```

- Show producer on the UI

```
gp preview --external https://astra.datastax.com/org/${ORGID}/streaming/pulsar-aws-useast2/tenants/${TENANT}/topics/namespaces/default/topics/rr-raw-in/1/0/producers
```

#### 1.4 Visualize messages (consumer)

Locate terminal `consumer` or open a new one with shorcut `CONTROL^ + SHIFT + ``.

- Load environment variables and start pulsar shell

```
set -a
source .env
set +a
astra streaming ${TENANT} pulsar-shell
```

- Launch a consumer in the console

```
client consume persistent://${TENANT}/default/rr-raw-in -s consume_log -n 0
```

- Show Consumers in the Astra User Interface

```
gp preview --external https://astra.datastax.com/org/${ORGID}/streaming/pulsar-aws-useast2/tenants/${TENANT}/topics/namespaces/default/topics/rr-raw-in/1/0/consumers
```

### LAB2 - Pulsar functions

#### 2.1 Create function

```
sed 's/___TENANT___/${TENANT}/' ./pulsar_routing_function/review_router.py
cat ./pulsar_routing_function/review_router.py | grep ${TENANT}
```

#### 2.2 Deploy function

When creating the function through the Astra Streaming UI:

- Name = `rrouter-function`, namespace = `default`;
- upload the `pulsar_routing_function/review_router.py` and pick the `ReviewRouter` function name;
- input topic: `default` and `rr-raw-in`;
- leave output/log topics empty;
- do not touch Advanced Configuration;
- no need for any further option configuration. Hit "Create".

The function will display as "Initializing" in the listing for some time
(20 s perhaps), then "Running". You're all set now.


```bash
admin functions list --tenant=${TENANT} --namespace=default
```

```bash
admin functions create \
  --py ./pulsar_routing_function/review_router.py \
  --classname review_router.ReviewRouter \
  --tenant ${TENANT} \
  --namespace default \
  --name rrouter-function \
  --inputs rr-raw-in
```

```bash
admin functions list --tenant=${TENANT} --namespace=default
```

```bash
admin functions delete \
  --tenant ${TENANT} \
  --namespace default \
  --name rrouter-function
```

- Show Restaurant Reviews

#### 2.3 Run Analyzer

https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-streaming/docs/astream-astradb-sink.html


> into the other topics as well. But if you are using Astra Streaming you may
> as well want to explore the "Try Me!" feature available directly in the Web UI,
> which allows to read and write items by hand from/to Astra Streaming topics.

Now start in rapid succession these three commands in the three shells and
enjoy the show:

# second shell
```
./revAnalyzer/review_analyzer.py -r -o -t -f 200
```

# third shell

```
./tools/reader.py -t rr-restaurant-anomalies
```

_Note_: you can customize the behaviour of those commands - try passing `-h`
to the scripts to see what is available.

### Querying the database


The only missing piece at this point are direct database queries. You can access
the tables in any way you want, for instance using the
provided [CQL shell on the Astra DB UI](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/awesome-astra/wiki/Cql-Shell):
just inspect the `trollsquad` keyspace and try to `SELECT` rows from the tables you find there.

> You will notice that the restaurant reviews are written in _two_ tables: one will simply
> contain the latest average score for each restaurant, the other is structured to offer
> historical data for e.g. a plotting client application (there is some built-in eviction
> of old results to avoid unbound growth of the table).

_Note:_ you just have to create the keyspace, since every time the analyzer starts
it checks for the tables and, if they do not exist, it creates them for you.

### Astra DB REST API

One of the nice things of Astra DB is that you effortlessly get various ways to interact
with your database through ordinary HTTP requests through
the [Stargate Data API](https://stargate.io/) on top of the underlying database.

The following examples are run with `cURL`, but of course they can be adapted
to any client able to issue simple HTTPS requests.

First source the `.env` file in a shell and construct the full base URL used in the subsequent requests:
```
. .env
ASTRA_URL_ROOT="https://${ASTRA_DB_ID}-${ASTRA_DB_REGION}.apps.astra.datastax.com/api/rest/v1/keyspaces/${ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE}/tables"
```

then try to run the following commands one by one and wee what the result looks like:

```
# What restaurants can be queried?
curl -s -X GET \
    "${ASTRA_URL_ROOT}/known_ids_per_type/rows/restaurant" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Cassandra-Token: ${ASTRA_DB_APP_TOKEN}" | python -mjson.tool


# What reviewers can be queried?
curl -s -X GET \
    "${ASTRA_URL_ROOT}/known_ids_per_type/rows/reviewer" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Cassandra-Token: ${ASTRA_DB_APP_TOKEN}" | python -mjson.tool


# What's the current status of a restaurant?
curl -s -X GET \
    "${ASTRA_URL_ROOT}/restaurants_by_id/rows/vegg00" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Cassandra-Token: ${ASTRA_DB_APP_TOKEN}" | python -mjson.tool


# What's the current status of a reviewer?
curl -s -X GET \
    "${ASTRA_URL_ROOT}/reviewers_by_id/rows/geri" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Cassandra-Token: ${ASTRA_DB_APP_TOKEN}" | python -mjson.tool


# What is the timeline of reviews for a restaurant?
curl -s -X GET \
    "${ASTRA_URL_ROOT}/restaurants_by_id_time/rows/gold_f" \
    -H "accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Cassandra-Token: ${ASTRA_DB_APP_TOKEN}" | python -mjson.tool
```
